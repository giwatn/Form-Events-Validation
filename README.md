# Form-Events-Validation

When the form is submitted, the checkTerms() function is called. This tests to see if the user has checked the box that indicates they agree to the terms and conditions.
if not, the script will prevent the default behavior of the form element (and stop it from submitting the form data to the server) and it will show an error message to the user. 

Moreover,In this example, as soon as the DOM tree has been formed, focus is given to the text input with an id of username. The DOMContentloaded event fires before the load event (because the latter waits for all of the page's resources to load). If users try to leave the page before they press the submit button, the beforeun load event checks that they want to leave.
